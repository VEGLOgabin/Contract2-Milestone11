Hand planked wood veneers in a rich, dark roast finish the color of freshly brewed coffee, show highlights of natural wood that has aged and is mildly distressed. Distressing includes rasping and chopping, along with varied species, solid wood plank tops that accent the dark finish and emphasize the wood’s natural beauty for two-tone authenticity. Antique bronze hardware adds a shimmering touch.\n*For full warranty benefits, register your product at https://www.martinfurniture.com/contact-us/",
