# Contract2-Milestone11


we need some additional edits. Please see below:

It appears the finishes are named “Colour” in the file for this scrape, and those are not all showing in the json file. Currently there is only one sku in the json file that has a finish, sku IMAY680. The remaining 332 items in the json file is missing the finish, and it looks like those are showing on the website. Also, can you remove the code in the scrape that gets the status, as the “Available Finishes” link does not indicate the status, but is just a link to the finishes section.
